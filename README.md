# Unit 7 App - Train Scheduler

## Motivation
I created this project as a homework assignment for the U.T. Coding Bootcamp.

## Tech/Framework Used
- jQuery
- Momentjs
- Firebase

## How to Use
Input data into the form at the bottom of the page and hit submit. The specified name, destination, and frequency will be displayed in the table at the top of the page. The arrival time of the next train and the amount of minutes it is away from the current time is also displayed using Momentjs calculations.
